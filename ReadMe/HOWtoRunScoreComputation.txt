In order to run ScoreComputation you have to compelete both runs described in HOWtoRunBayesBaseNew.
You have to make a table named PlayersCalss with the format of `Premier_League_Midfielder_Dec2015_CorrelationSchema`.`PlayersClass` where you label
which data points are outlier which are not: then in the ScoreComputation/src/config.cfg change all database name to your databasename. OriginalDB should 
be name of result database of your first run and GeneralDB should be for your second run. OutlierIndex should be the label of outlier class in the PlayersClass.
Threshold shows number of known outliers in data and NonOutlier  number of non outlier.
