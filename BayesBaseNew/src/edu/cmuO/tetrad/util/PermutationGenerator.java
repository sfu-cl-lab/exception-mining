/**
 * Generates all of the permutations of [0,..., numObjects - 1], where numObjects is numObjects nonnegative
 * integer.  The values of numObjects is given in the constructor, and the sequence of
 * choices is obtained by repeatedly calling the next() method.  When the
 * sequence is finished, null is returned.
 * <p/>
 * A valid combination for the sequence of combinations for numObjects choose b generated
 * by this class is an array x[] of b integers representing the above
 * permutation.
 * <p/>
 * To see what this class does, try calling PermutationGenerator.testPrint(5),
 * for instance.
