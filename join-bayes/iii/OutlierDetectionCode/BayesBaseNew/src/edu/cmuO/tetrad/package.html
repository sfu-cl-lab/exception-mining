<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<P>These packages contain a set of mathematical &quot;models&quot; (coded in
    Java)
    for Tetrad-style graphs, data structures, search algorithms, estimators,
    etc. Theory
    is described Spirtes, Glymour, and Scheines, <i>Causation, Prediction, and
    Search</i>
    (1993, 2000). </P>

<P>Note that there should be no references from any of these edu.cmu.edu.tetrad
    packages to any of the edu.cmu.edu.tetradapp packages.</P>

<P>One goal we have is to get these packages stabilized so that they can be used
    outside of the Tetrad application without significant fear of
    incompatibility.</P>
